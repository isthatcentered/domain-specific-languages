# How to

## How to guide the exercises

- Do 1st yourself, explain your thought process
- Then, for each exercise
  - Let them do first
  - Ask for their solutions
  - Do it together, explain your thought process
- Ask questions about their experience (see training sheet below)

## Training sheet

### 01-INTRO

Goal:

#### Exercise 01

Goal:
Prompts:
- What surprised you?
- Can you see a difference between `readFile` and `chain`?

#### Exercise 02

Goal:
Prompts:
- How did it feel to use?
- Was the specification complexity increase an issue?
- What surprised you?
- What about the separation between the resulting config structure and the environment's actual structure?
- What are the gains/costs of this method?
  - Verbose
  - Might be weird/time to learn
  - Looks deceptively simple
- What are the benefits of this method?
  - Declarative/expressive
  - Hides a lot of complexity
  -	Complete type-safety (literal/optional/sub-structs/type...)
- What can you tell about the types returned by each operator you used (recursive, type stays the same, only A changes, no implementation detail leaked)
